# GHCR deployment backlog

Seeded 2026-07-11 from FINDINGS.md (2026-06-09 review, verified against code at
seeding time) and WORKFLOW-HARDENING-PLAN.md. Entry format:
`[severity] summary — source · file:line pointer`.

## Open

- (none)

## Resolved by 2026-07-12 hardening plan

- §6.3 and §13.2 now state that container build definitions are operator-provided, probed, and never seeded.

## Settled — do not reopen

- GHCR stays single-job OIDC (R7-4, accepted documented scope with in-file rationale); only the byte-identity scan→push (promote the exact scanned OCI archives by digest, C12-W3) is in scope.
